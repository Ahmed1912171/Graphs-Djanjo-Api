# Graphs-Djanjo-Api
Build a web application using Next.js on the frontend and integrate it with a Django API backend. The application will feature a basic dashboard page with multiple charts (Candlestick, Line Chart, Bar Chart, and Pie Chart), and the data will be retrieved from the backend (it can be hardcoded in the backend).
